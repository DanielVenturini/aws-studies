# Introduction to Amazon Web Services

This course contains all the required information to make users comfortable discussing AWS. There is a bunch of available tools on AWS, as the following:

- Compute
- Storage
- Network security
- Blockchain
- Machine learning
- Artificial intelligence
- Robot development
- Video production

AWS works on the client-serve requests model. Client makes a request which is **promised** by AWS resources. The key concept of AWS is **You only pay for what you use**. That is the principle of the **on-demand**, that is, the administrator does not pre-play for anything, but the administrator may allocate more resources for a specific time and pay for them, and after that, the administrator may unallocate these resources and stop paying immediately for them.

The **Cloud Computing** is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. AWS provides a huge bunch of IT resources because businesses need them, even when most of them are not used by most of the AWS' clients. This is called **Undifferentiated heavy lifting of IT**. It means that the engine does not make the difference to clients, that is, it does not matter whether the data is on MySQL or PostgreSQL, but AWS provides a way to store intelligently the data on any technology.
