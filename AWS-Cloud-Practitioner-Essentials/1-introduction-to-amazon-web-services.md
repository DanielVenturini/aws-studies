# Introduction to Amazon Web Services

This course contains all the required information to make users comfortable discussing AWS. There is a bunch of available tools on AWS, as the following:

- Compute
- Storage
- Network security
- Blockchain
- Machine learning
- Artificial intelligence
- Robot development
- Video production
- Orbital satellites

AWS works on the client-serve requests model. Client makes a request which is **promised** by AWS resources. The key concept of AWS is **You only pay for what you use**. That is the principle of the **on-demand**, that is, the administrator does not pre-play for anything, but the administrator may allocate more resources for a specific time and pay for them, and after that, the administrator may unallocate these resources and stop paying immediately for them.

The **Cloud Computing** is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. AWS provides a huge bunch of IT resources because businesses need them, even when most of them are not used by most of the AWS' clients. This is called **Undifferentiated heavy lifting of IT**. It means that the engine does not make the difference to clients, that is, it does not matter whether the data is on MySQL or PostgreSQL, but AWS provides a way to store intelligently the data on any technology.

### [Models for Cloud Computing](https://www.hostingseekers.com/blog/cloud-computing-vs-on-premises/)

There are different types of models/strategy when thinking about cloud computing. Some models fit better for one business requirements, and other models for other requirements. There are three cloud computing deployment models:

1. **Cloud based**: on this deployment, all applications are hosted on the cloud. Existing applications and services should be migrated to cloud and all of them run on cloud and use tools on cloud. For example, a company that has an application running on cloud that uses databases, virtual machines and networking that are fully based in the cloud. All of the security, updates and management are responsibility of the cloud owner.
2. **On-premises**: this deployment aims to use virtualization and resource management tools to create and deploy the client's stuff on its on-premises data center. **Usually used by legacy IT applications**. Client runs everything on its own technology and infrastructure. It's fully customizable and there is no access restricted. However, security, update, qos and everything depends are responsibility of the client.
3. **Hybrid**: connect cloud-based resources to on-premises infrastructure. This model connects the legacy IT applications with the cloud-based resources. Hybrid model is useful when some data may not be stored/processed out of the business boundary.

The cloud computing has several benefits when considering with others model. The first one is the smallest (or even not existing) **trade upfront expense**. In this case, the client does not have to invest money on resources that need to be ready before application running, for example, hard drive to store the SO, network link to connect to the Internet and so on. **Without the infrastructure data-centers**, companies can save a lot of money and time keeping those legacy and wired infrastructure stuffs. Another benefit is the capacity to use as much as need resources on cloud computing. If the application uses so much memory, the cloud has this amount of memory; if the application uses just a bit of memory, the cloud has it too, but the good news is that **on the cloud the client just pays for the resources that the client uses**, and not the full price for the resource.
